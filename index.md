Hi, there.

I work at [Honey Insurance](https://www.honeyinsurance.com/), the #1 fastest growing tech company in Australiaüò≤.

I worked at Atlassian on [Jira Service Management](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-management/features/service-desk)
for a fair while.

I did [quite a bit of work on Magnolia CMS](https://git.magnolia-cms.com/ " ‚Äí it looks like this Git link is not available, and the core product is not available in their open source GitHub and BitBucket repositories either anymore either ‚òπÔ∏è") in the past.

I have some projects on GitHub: [https://github.com/gjoseph/]().

I have some projects on Bitbucket: [https://bitbucket.org/hpesojg/]().

I do some other things, too.

```java
System.out.println("Hello");
```
