Hi, there.

I currently work on JIRA Service Desk: https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-desk

I did quite a bit of work on Magnolia CMS in the past: https://git.magnolia-cms.com/

I have some projects on GitHub: https://github.com/gjoseph/

I have some projects on Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/hpesojg/

I do some other things, too.

```java
System.out.println("Hello");
```
