Hi, there.

I work at [Honey Insurance](https://www.honeyinsurance.com/), the #1 fastest growing tech company in Australia üò≤

I worked at Atlassian on [Jira Service Management](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-management/features/service-desk)
for a fair while.

I did [quite a bit of work on Magnolia CMS](https://git.magnolia-cms.com/ " ‚Äí it lookslike the core product is not available in their open source [repo](https://bitbucket.org/magnolia-cms/workspace/repositories/)[sitories](https://github.com/magnolia-cms) anymore ‚òπÔ∏è") in the past.

I have some projects on GitHub: https://github.com/gjoseph/

I have some projects on Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/hpesojg/

I do some other things, too.

```java
System.out.println("Hello");
```
